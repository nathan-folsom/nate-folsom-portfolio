I merge the disciplines of UX design and front-end development in order to efficiently build web experiences. Design fundamentals such as interaction design, information architecture, and visual design inform my decisions as I execute them with technology such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and React. I thrive on the ability to advocate for both design and engineering and assure that the product reflects a smooth integration.
