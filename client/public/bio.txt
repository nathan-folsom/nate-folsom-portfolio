Hi, I'm Nate! I originally found my way into tech when I completed a UX design bootcamp in spring of 2019, however I soon after decided that software engineering was more up my alley. Coding my first design portfolio with plain HTML and CSS eventually turned into learning JavaScript, frontend frameworks, TypeScript, backend, and higher level software engineering concepts. Writing code is my happy place, and I'm always interested in learning new skills and ways of increasing the quality of my code. I'm super excited about tech startups and the future of remote work. Outside of the office, I'm an avid rock climber, hiker and gym-goer.
