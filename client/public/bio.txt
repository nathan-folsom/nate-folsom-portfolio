Hi, I’m Nate! Coding is my craft, and the opportunity to solve interesting, challenging, and high-impact problems is a never ending source of inspiration. I work on the full web stack, primarily JavaScript/TypeScript, Java, and HTML/CSS. Outside of the office, I’m an avid hiker, rock climber, and outdoors enthusiast.
